To ensure your Codespace environment is fully equipped for CrewAI development, please create a file named requirements.txt in the root directory of your GitHub repository.

The content for requirements.txt should be as follows:

# Core CrewAI and LangChain dependencies
crewai==0.30.11             # The main CrewAI framework
langchain==0.2.5            # Core LangChain library
langchain-community==0.2.5  # Community integrations for LangChain (e.g., local LLMs, tools)

# LLM Integrations (choose based on your LLM provider)
# If using OpenAI's API (ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.)
openai==1.35.13

# If using local LLMs via Ollama (requires Ollama to be running, e.g., in Docker via devcontainer.json)
ollama==0.1.8             # Uncomment if you plan to use Ollama for local models

# If using other LLM providers, add their respective client libraries here:
anthropic==0.26.0
google-generativeai==0.7.0
cohere==5.4.0

# Web Frameworks (if your agent app has a web interface or API)
fastapi==0.111.0            # For building REST APIs for your agents
uvicorn==0.30.1             # ASGI server to run FastAPI applications

# Environment variable management
python-dotenv==1.0.1        # For loading environment variables from a .env file

# Data Handling and Analysis (common for Data Scientists)
pandas==2.2.2               # For data manipulation and analysis
numpy==1.26.4               # For numerical operations
scikit-learn==1.5.0         # For traditional ML tasks or data preprocessing

# Optional: Tools for your agents (examples)
# If agents need to browse the web
beautifulsoup4==4.12.3
requests==2.32.3

# If agents need to interact with specific APIs, add their client libraries here:
# For example, if an agent needs to use a specific database client:
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
pymongo==4.7.2

# For testing (optional, but highly recommended for robust apps)
pytest==8.2.2
pytest-asyncio==0.23.0

# For type checking (optional, but good practice for larger projects)
mypy==1.10.0

# For code formatting and linting (optional, but good for team consistency)
black==24.4.2
ruff==0.4.9
